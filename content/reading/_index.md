## Design Pattern

### Law of Demeter

- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
- **Only talk to your immediate friends.**

## Microservices

- [Events on the Outside vs Events on the Inside](https://codesimple.blog/2021/03/14/events-on-the-outside-vs-events-on-the-inside/).
